# Food-Website
A website that allows the user to search for nearby restaurants, caf√©s, or bakeries using Google Map's Places API, BootStrap, and jquery

**Note clicking on the map doesn't work on github pages, but works locally. Need to solve this issue, i believe i need to update google maps javascript api**

To use: Click on the images to select which options you would like to find.

For this project, I used Google Map's Places API for the map interface, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jquery to create a responsive website and interactive website.
