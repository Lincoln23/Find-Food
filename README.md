# Food-Website
A website that allows the user to search for nearby restaurants, caf√©s, or bakeries using Google Map's Places API, BootStrap, and jquery

**NOTE CLICKING ON THE MAP DOESN'T WORK ON GITHUB PAGES, BUT WORKS LOCALLY. NEED TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE, I BELIEVE I NEED TO UPDATE Google Maps JavaScript API**

To use: Click on the images to select which options you would like to find.

For this project, I used Google Map's Places API for the map interface, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jquery to create a responsive website and interactive website.
