# Food-Website
A website that allows the user to search for nearby restaurants, cafes or bakery shops using Google Map's Places API, BootStrap and jquery

To use: Click on the images to select which options you would like to find.

For this project I used Google Map's Places API for the map interface, HTML, Bootstrap CSS and jquery to create a scaleable website and interacative website
